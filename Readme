Explaination of script:
Nested Queries:

First Query: WITH daily_totals AS (SELECT DATE(transaction_time) AS transaction_date, SUM(transaction_amount) AS total_amount FROM transactions GROUP BY DATE(transaction_time))

"This is a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the total transaction amount for each day"

Second Query: rolling_avg AS (SELECT transaction_date, AVG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_3_day_avg FROM daily_totals
)

"This CTE calculates the rolling 3-day average of the total transaction amounts"

Final Query: SELECT transaction_date, rolling_3_day_avg FROM rolling_avg
"This part filters the results to only show the rolling 3-day average for January 31"
